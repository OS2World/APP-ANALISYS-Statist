  The two sed programs "DE_delAccents.sed" and "delAccents.sed"
  are useful if you are running statist in a language other than
  English and can't put the accents to be correctly displayed on
  the screen. I had this problem while testing statist in CygWin
  on Windows 98. You can use one of the two programs to strip
  all accents from a text file. The script DE_delAccents.sed is
  good for German texts; for example, it converts the letter `ü'
  into `ue'.  The script delAccents.sed is good for many other
  European languages; when it finds a letter with accent, it
  outputs the same letter without the accent.

     Example of usage:

       sed -f delAccents.sed pt_BR.po > new_pt_BR.po
