QUICK START
===========

  The "*.dat" files in this directory are examples of statist data files.
  To open them, just do:

	statist data_file

  To open the file city.dat with its labels, and to have a colored output:

	statist --color city.dat --labels city.labels 

SOME DETAILS
===============

  The extensions ".dat" to data files and ".labels" to labels files are just a
  convenience. You can give any name you want to these kind of files.
  
  Please, open the files with your preferred text editor to see what is inside
  them. Some things that you might note while inspecting the files: (a) you can
  insert comments in data files; (b) fields might be separated by more than one
  tab or space; (c) if you want to include the names of columns you must add
  "#%" at the begin of the line with the names; (d) the format of the labels
  file is very simple; (e) you can't use strings as values (or factors), but
  you can attribute names to numbers if you use a labels file.
  
  Please, read the "User Manual" for complete explanation on how to prepare
  data files for statist.
